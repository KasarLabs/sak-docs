This is the welcome page where we explain the kit

First explaining that it is for people to deploy agent that interact with the starknet chain

Agents can be deployed with a specific configuration with context and allowed tools or without config and the default context with all tools

Agents can be autonomous based on context and tools or interactive based on a chat to give orders

The kit contains a nest js server to comunicate with the agent

The kit also contains a client frontend to chat with the agent

The kit also contains an internal menu with either chat or auto to give orders or deploy autonomous agent

The kit is also a package so that users can integrate the agent to their dapps like that:

import { StarknetAgent } from 'starknet-agent-kit';

const agent = new StarknetAgent({
  aiProviderApiKey: 'your-ai-provider-key',
  aiProvider: 'anthropic', // or 'openai', 'gemini', 'ollama'
  aiModel: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-latest',
  accountPrivateKey: 'your-wallet-private-key',
  rpcUrl: 'your-rpc-url',
});

// Execute commands in natural language
await agent.execute('transfer 0.1 ETH to 0x123...');
await agent.execute('What is my ETH balance?');
await agent.execute('Swap 5 USDC for ETH');
